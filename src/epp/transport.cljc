  "RFC 5734 framing: EPP over TCP is a stream of length-prefixed XML documents.

  Each data unit is a 32-bit **network-byte-order** total length followed by
  the XML. The length **includes its own four header bytes** — RFC 5734 §4 says
  so in one sentence, and getting it wrong by four is the single most common
  EPP interop bug. The two directions are written next to each other here so
  that the `+ 4` and the `- 4` cannot be maintained separately.

  Bytes are plain integer vectors, not host buffers, so this namespace is
  `.cljc` and the framing is testable without a socket. A JVM socket layer that
  fills a `byte[]` and a Node one that fills a `Buffer` both hand a vector of
  unsigned bytes to `decode` and get a string back.

  Why a maximum frame size is enforced here rather than by the caller: the
  length prefix is attacker-controlled. A peer that sends `0xFFFFFFFF` and then
  stops is asking a server to allocate 4 GiB and wait — the read loop is the
  only place with the information to refuse, and refusing after allocation is
  too late."

  unusually large frames should raise it deliberately rather than discover the
